## Automated Account Addition

For eligible FIs, VerifyNow allows users to add accounts without providing information such as routing or account numbers. Instead, they may use Real-Time Verification and Addition, as described below.
When the Automated Account Flow is Triggered

The following flow is applicable when:

•	Client has enabled RTVA via the DGF

•	Account and Routing Number are NOT passed in the API invoking the widget

•	RTVA is not FALSE in the API. Please see the integration guide for more details.

**Note:** Even when RTVA is enabled, users can choose to add any account manually.
