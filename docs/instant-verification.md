FIS has built relationships with several authorized printing facilities who print checks for financial institutions. Through these printing facilities, FIS has access to customer name and account number information. The FIS database is limited by the number of check printing facilities with which FIS has a relationship. Furthermore, not all Financial Institutions allow the check-printing facilities to disclose the information of their clients.



### Early Warning Services (EWS) ®

EWS houses data contributed by various financial institutions and uses this data to authenticate account ownership claims. EWS data is limited by the number of financial institutions that contribute to this product. EWS requires that clients contribute data to the product in order to be allowed to use it. With Early Warning Services, instant account verification occurs in-session with no user interaction required.

EWS has been enhanced with new data elements, including Enhanced Name Matching, Account Status, and Account Score for non-participating banks

Instant Verification process are as follows:

- Once the user adds the account, Transfer Now checks the ABA number against the FIS database to confirm that it is a supported ABA number.
- If confirmed YES, Transfer Now matches the users name and account information against those in the FIS database.
- If a match is found in FIS or EWS, as appropriate, then the Verification Complete screen is displayed, and the Verify Your Account step is complete.
- If a match is not found in FIS or EWS, then the user is directed either to real-time verification or trial deposit verification.
