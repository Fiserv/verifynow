## VerifyNow Functions

Fiserv ePayments VerifyNow provides account verification services for account funding and account-to-account transfer transactions. With VerifyNow, clients can verify account ownership for transactions such as biller direct payments, prepaid card loading, and cash disbursements. During verification, VerifyNow determines whether: 
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li> An account exists </li>

<li> The customer owns the account </li>

<li> The account is active and in good standing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
